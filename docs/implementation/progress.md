# Implementation Progress

This file is the durable progress ledger for the Mirabilis roadmap. Agents must update it after every task transition so work can resume after history compaction, app restart, or scheduled automation runs.

Status markers:

- `[ ]` not started.
- `[~]` in progress.
- `[x]` complete and merged to `master`.
- `[!]` blocked and needs user input or a prerequisite not represented in the task index.

## Current Mode

- Mode: autonomous task-by-task development.
- Canonical branch: `master`.
- Task source: `docs/implementation/task-index.md`.
- Workflow source: `.codex/skills/mirabilis-dev-runner/SKILL.md`.
- Selection rule: choose the first `[ ]` task whose dependencies are `[x]` or only "preferred".
- Completion rule: all acceptance criteria met, focused tests pass, local gate appropriate to the change passes, P0/P1 findings fixed, task branch merged to `master`, and task line changed to `[x]`.

### 2026-05-19 20:51 CST - TASK-003 started

- Branch: `feat/task-003-in-memory-page-store`.
- Task: Add in-memory Page Store.
- Scope: implement in-memory Markdown Page CRUD/list/archive behavior using TASK-002 Core domain types while preserving stable page IDs, timestamps, and structured document block IDs.
- Agent orchestration: parent thread remains orchestration-only; planner/docs/test/implementation/review work is delegated to agents and summarized in `docs/implementation/agent-communication/TASK-003-in-memory-page-store.md`.

### 2026-05-19 20:46 CST - TASK-002 completed

- Branch: `feat/task-002-core-domain-types`.
- Task: Create TypeScript core domain types.
- Commits: `dd4979e` tests, `5bb7ae3` implementation, `0f7b07e` orchestration docs, `7e77fe6` test review fixes, `768e93e` testing strategy docs.
- Delivered: `src/core` type-only entrypoint and type modules for `MarkdownPage`, `StructuredMarkdownDocument`, `MetadataRecord`, `AppEvent`, `FilterDefinition`, and supporting block/metadata/filter types; focused type-contract tests; production Core boundary test; agent communication status docs.
- Validation: `bun run check:quick` passed, `bun run build` passed, focused targeted re-review agents reported no remaining P0/P1/P2 findings.
- External docs verified by agents: TypeScript module/type-only/isolated module guidance, Vitest `expectTypeOf` and type testing guidance, Vite TypeScript transpile behavior, Vite 7 Node requirements, and TypeScript compiler API modifier guidance.
- Remaining risk: `bun run check:full` was not run because TASK-002 does not touch Tauri IPC, permissions, filesystem, persistence, packaging, or release behavior.

### 2026-05-19 19:54 CST - TASK-002 started

- Branch: `feat/task-002-core-domain-types`.
- Scope: define TypeScript Core domain types for Markdown pages, structured Markdown documents, metadata records, app events, and filter definitions without business-plugin behavior.
- Agent orchestration: parent thread remains orchestration-only; planner/docs/test/implementation/review work is delegated to agents.

### 2026-05-19 19:51 CST - TASK-001 completed

- Branch: `feat/task-001-local-check-scripts-v2`.
- Commits: `3a6f273` test, `dfe3494` implementation, `6057581` local-check docs, `ebee421` review fixes, `3f6e85f` Node prerequisite docs, `be08473` gate wording docs.
- Delivered: Bun package scripts for `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:frontend`, `fmt:rust`, `clippy`, `test:rust`, `check:quick`, and `check:full`; Vitest/jsdom/React Testing Library setup; ESLint flat config for TypeScript, React Hooks, React Refresh, Testing Library, and jest-dom; focused frontend test proving the stack.
- Validation: `bun run check:quick` passed, `bun run build` passed, review agents reported no P0/P1 findings, security review found no security-sensitive changes.
- External docs verified by agents: Vite 7 Node.js support, Vitest config/`mergeConfig`, Testing Library React and user-event guidance, jest-dom Vitest setup, ESLint flat config, and Tauri/Cargo local check commands.
- Remaining risk: `bun run check:full` was not run because TASK-001 does not touch packaging, IPC, permissions, filesystem, persistence, or release behavior.

### 2026-05-19 19:02 CST - TASK-001 started

- Branch: `feat/task-001-local-check-scripts-v2`.
- Scope: establish Bun scripts for typecheck, lint, frontend tests, Rust checks, quick/full gates, and document the exact commands.
- Agent orchestration: started fresh from `master` after validating project agent TOML and specialized `test_writer`/`implementer` health checks.
